### Q1. What are some new things happening in the web?
1. `Blockchain Technology` - Blockchain is an encrypted database storing system. Unlike conventional systems, it stores information in blocks, which are then joined as a chain. It offers innumerable benefits, one of which is it makes transactions more secure and error-free. 

2. `Web 3.0` - Web 3.0 is the next generation of the internet, where data is more decentralized and controlled by individuals rather than large corporations. This trend is gaining momentum with the rise of blockchain technology and the decentralization of applications and services.

3. `Voice Search` - Growing Each Year

4. `Web Assembly` - WebAssembly is a low-level programming language that allows developers to write code in languages like C++, Rust, and Go and run them on the web. This technology enables faster performance for web applications and games and is becoming more widely adopted.

5. `WebXR ` - WebXR is a new web API that enables developers to create virtual and augmented reality experiences on the web. This technology is still in its early stages but is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years.

6.  `AI-Powered Chatbots`
